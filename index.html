            <strong>A few events of tyrannosaur research:</strong>
        </legend>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1990</strong> José Bonaparte and others classified tyrannosaurs as carnosaurs</li> 
            <li><strong>1991</strong> Farlow and others studied tyrannosaur tooth biomechanics, finding them to be more resistant to forces in both the front-to-back and side-to-side planes than the more blade-like teeth of other carnivorous dinosaurs</li> 
            <li><strong>1992</strong> Kenneth Carpenter described the new genus Maleevosaurus.</li> 
            <li><strong>1993</strong> Bernardino Pérez Pérez-Moreno and others performed another phylogenetic analysis of the Tyrannosauridae and found additional support for reclassifying the family as coelurosaurs. They found that within the coelurosaurs, tyrannosaurs were arctometatarsalians. In other words, they were more closely related to the ostrich dinosaurs than to birds</li> 
            <li><strong>1994</strong>
            Pérez-Moreno and others performed another phylogenetic analysis of the Tyrannosauridae and found additional support for reclassifying the family as coelurosaurs. They found tyrannosaurids to lie outside of the Maniraptoriformes. In other words, they are less closely related to birds than the ostrich dinosaurs are.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1995</strong>
            Emily B. Giffin observed that the brachial plexus of the tyrannosaurid neural canal was smaller than those of other theropods, suggesting that tyrannosaurids really did have reduced forlimb function.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1996</strong>
            Osmólska described the new genus and species Bagaraatan ostromi.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1997</strong>
            Richard Cifelli and others reported teeth from Utah that exhibited the distinctive thickening characterizing tyrannosaurid teeth that date back to the Albian-Cenomanian boundary. As such, they were the oldest known tyrannosaurid teeth.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1998</strong>
            Sereno performed another phylogenetic analysis of the Tyrannosauridae and found additional support for reclassifying the family as coelurosaurs. He defined the tyrannosauridae as all tyrannosauroids closer to Tyrannosaurus than to Alectrosaurus, Aublysodon, or Nanotyrannus.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1999</strong>
            Alexander Kellner described the new genus and species Santanaraptor placidus.Santanaraptor is a possible tyrannosauroid. If so, it is the only known member of the group that would have inhabited the super continent of Gondwana.
            </li>
            <li><strong>2000</strong>
            Oliver Walter Mischa Rauhut reported the presence of Stokesosaurus or an extremely close relative in Portugal.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the most ferocious predators to ever walk the Earth. With a massive body, sharp teeth, and jaws so powerful they could crush a car, this famous carnivore dominated the forested river valleys in western North America during the late Cretaceous period, 68 million years ago. <br>
